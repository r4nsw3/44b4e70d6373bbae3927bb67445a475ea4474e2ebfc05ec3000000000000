  |   It's hard to believe that it's been nearly a year since we've         |
  |   launched Wizard of Legend! Thank you all for your amazing support!    |
  |   In celebration, we'll be updating the game with a Boss Rush Mode!     |
  |   This free update will be available later this month and will be a     |
  |   streamlined experience where you can face off against the bosses in   |
  |   the game in quick succession! Also included in this update will be    |
  |   about 20 new relics to discover and a variety of quality of life      |
  |   changes. We'll be sure to post a full list of patch notes once it     |
  |   goes live!                                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Also, we'd like to announce that we'll be moving forward to round     |
  |   out the game with a lightning stage and boss fight, which will be     |
  |   on a similar scale to the Sky Palace that was launched in March!      |
  |   While it's still very early, we'll be sure to post updates            |
  |   regarding our progress as we work, so stay tuned!                     |
